Maha Super Flexi Housing Loan Scheme
Maha Super Flexi Housing Loan Scheme
(Term Loan linked with Saving Account.)
In this Home loan scheme, the borrowersâ€™ account is linked to a dedicated savings account. So, when a borrower deposits the surplus money to the account, it will be considered credit towards the loan, thus reducing the interest on the outstanding loan amount. Also, if needed, the borrower has option to withdraw money whenever required. The loan will get rebalanced accordingly.
