What is a Personal Loan?
A Personal Loan is a loan that can be availed for any personal purpose such as home renovation, wedding, medical emergencies, travelling, debt repayments, bill payments and more. Unlike other loans, Personal Loan does not require any collateral or security and can be easily availed with minimum documentation. Like any other loan, you can repay Personal Loan with EMI (Equated Monthly Instalments); debited from your bank account.
