What is the maximum age at loan maturity?
The age at loan maturity should not exceed 75 years. This is subject to an assessment of the applicant's income to ensure they can meet repayment obligations until the age of 75 years.
For individuals with income only up to 60 years, the loan term should not exceed the age of 60 years unless there is a proven source of income post-retirement.
